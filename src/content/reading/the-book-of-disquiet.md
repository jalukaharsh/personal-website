In Pessoa you will find a sympathetic yet abject soul. He gives an expression to the meaninglessness, irrationality and unjust of life like few others, and that certainly has immense beauty and literary value. 

Unfortunately, however, Pessoa does not transcend his maladies. His reaction to his disquietude is resignatory, destructive, sadistic, and ultimately, uninspiring.
