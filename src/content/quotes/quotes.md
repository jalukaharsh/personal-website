On the road halfway between faith and criticism stands the inn of reason. Reason is faith in what can be understood without faith, but it’s still a faith, since to understand presupposes that there’s something understandable. 
- Fernando Pessoa 

For if serenity should be a hallmark of maturity, then impetuousness should be a hallmark of youth.
- Amor Towles

To teach how to live without certainty, and yet without being paralysed by hesitation, is perhaps the chief thing that philosophy, in our age, can still do for those who study it.

An educated man should admire any course of study no matter how arcane, if it be pursued with curiosity and devotion.

I have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night.

We all get dealt cards. Some of us get better cards than others. And while it’s easy to get hung up on our cards, and feel we got screwed over, the real game lies in the choices we make with those cards, the risks we decide to take, and the consequences we choose to live with. 
- Mark Manson

Be the supernova in the darkness of the cosmos.
- Neil deGrasse Tyson

In a world of angry birds and flappy birds, novels are much less useful as tools of mere distraction than they used to be.
- John Green

All those paper people living in their paper houses, burning the future to stay warm. All the paper kids drinking beer some bum bought for them at the paper convenience store. Everyone demented with the mania of owning things. All the things paper-thin and paper-frail. And all the people too. I've lived here for eighteen years and I have never once in my life come across anyone who cares about anything that matters.
- John Green, Paper Towns

A room without books is like a body without a soul.

What do you care what other people think? 
- Richard Feynman, Surely You’re Joking Mr Feynman

I was born not knowing and have only had a little time to change that here and there. 
- Richard Feynman

Reading is escape, and the opposite of escape; it’s a way to make contact with reality after a day of making things up, and it’s a way of making contact with someone else’s imagination after a day that’s all too real.
- Nora Ephron

It’s never too late to be what you might have been
- George Eliot 

Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement.

No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally - and often far more - worth reading at the age of fifty and beyond.
- C.S. Lewis

It’s a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don’t keep your feet, there’s no knowing where you might be swept off to.

I encourage all of us, whatever our beliefs, to question the basic narratives of our world, to connect past developments with present concerns, and not be afraid of controversial issues.
- Yuval Noah Harari

We are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it is forever. 
- Carl Sagan

Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.

Care about what other people think and you will always be their prisoner.

As our circle of knowledge expands, so does the circumference of darkness surrounding it.

Open your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever.

What do we call visible light? We call it colour. But the electromagnetic spectrum runs to zero in one direction and infinity in the other, so really, children, mathematically, all of light is invisible.

When all you’ve ever known is privilege, equality feels like oppression.
- Adam Rutherford 

“I wish it need not have happened in my time,” said Frodo. “So do I,” said Gandalf, “and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.”
- J.R.R. Tolkien

Make everything as simple as it can be. But no simpler.
- Albert Einstein 

One glance through a book and you hear the voice of another person, perhaps someone dead for 1000 years. To read is to voyage through time.

I go down to the shore in the morning and depending on the hour the waves are rolling in or moving out,

what shall- 
what should I do? And the sea says in its lovely voice: 
Excuse me, I have work to do.

What you do with your attention is, in the end, what you do with your life.
- John Green 

We are all one species, sharing one profoundly interconnected world. And humans, all humans, are our people. And when the oppressed and marginalised die because they are oppressed and marginalised, the powerful are at fault.
- John Green

Who is more humble? The scientist who looks at the universe with an open mind and accepts whatever the universe has to teach us? Or somebody who says everything in this book must be considered the literal truth and never mind the fallibility of all the human beings involved in the writing of this book. 
- Carl Sagan

Looking to the future, it’s not the Mexicans or Chinese who will take the jobs from the people in Pennsylvania, it’s the robots and algorithms. So, unless you plan to build a big wall on the border of California, the wall on the border with Mexico is going to be very ineffective. 
- Yuval Noah Harari 

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.
- Carl Sagan

If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.

- Hagrid, J. K. Rowling

Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it.
- Dumbledore (Movie) 

With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil—that takes religion.
- Steven Weinberg

Is God willing to prevent evil but unable to do so? Then he is not omnipotent.
Is God able to prevent evil but unwilling to do so? Then he is malevolent (or at least less than perfectly good).
If God is both willing and able to prevent evil then why is there evil in the world?
- Epicurus’ Trilemma 

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another which states that this has already happened. 
- Douglas Adams 

In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. 
- Douglas Adams 

Isn’t it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too?
- Douglas Adams

The truth may be puzzling. It may take some work to grapple with. It may be counterintuitive. It may contradict deeply held prejudices. It may not be consonant with what we desperately want to be true. But preferences do not determine what’s true. 
- Carl Sagan 

We ignore public understanding of science at our peril.
- Carl Sagan 

I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! When I shall have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not a library of my own.

So, now I too am an official member of the guild of whores.

The question today is how one can convince humanity to consent to their own survival.
- Bertrand Russell (paraphrased) 

When people have rejected aristocracy, no longer believe that leadership is inherited at birth, no longer assume that the ruling class is endorsed by god, the argument about who gets to rule - who is the elite - is never over.

People have always had different opinions. Now they have different facts.

Worrying is the correct worldview. Life is worrisome.

Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn’t it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up.

In the best conversations, you don’t even remember what you talked about, only how it felt.

In three words I can sum up everything I’ve learned about life - it goes on.

He avoids them, for they remind him too much of the way his parents choose to live, befriending people not so much because they like them, but because of a past they happen to share.

As a general rule, people, even the wicked, are much more naive and simple-hearted than we suppose. And we ourselves are, too.

You should never underestimate human stupidity. It is one of the most powerful forces that shape history. 
- Yuval Noah Harari 

We have bred docile cows that produce enormous amounts of milk but are otherwise far inferior to their wild ancestors. They are less agile, less curious, and less resourceful. We are now creating tame humans that produce enormous amounts of data and function as very efficient chips in a huge data-processing mechanism, but these data-cows hardly maximise the human potential.
- Yuval Noah Harari

If we are not careful, we will end up with downgraded humans misusing upgraded computers to wreak havoc on themselves and the world.

By unrighteousness man prospers, gains what appears desirable, conquers enemies, but perishes at the root.
- Rabindranath Tagore

Often, strong beliefs are needed precisely when the story isn’t true.
- Yuval Noah Harari

I’m always inclined to believe that the best way of knowing [the divine] is to love a great deal. Love that friend, that person, that thing, whatever you like, you’ll be on the right path to knowing more thoroughly, afterwards; that’s what I say to myself. But you must love with a high, serious intimate sympathy, with a will, with intelligence, and you must always seek to know more thoroughly, better and more. 
- Vincent van Gogh 

But what kind of India will they leave behind, what stark misery? When the stream of their centuries’ administration runs dry at last, what a waste of mud and filth they will leave behind them!

If you cannot afford to waste time, you will never find the truth.
- Yuval Noah Harari

We don’t get to choose if we hurt in this world, old man, but we do have a say in who hurts us. I know I like my choices. I hope she likes hers.
- John Green

The greatest food is the knowledge of the union which the mind has with the whole of nature... The more the mind knows the better it understands its forces and the order of nature; the more it understands it’s forces or strength, the better it will be able to direct itself and lay down rules for itself; and the more it understands the order of nature the more easily it will
be able to liberate itself from useless things; this is the whole method.
- Spinoza

To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that’s all.
- Oscar Wilde

The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts, while the stupid ones are full of confidence.

The free soul is rare, but you know it when you see it - basically because you feel good, very good, when you are near or with them.
- Charles Bukowski

The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity.

Everything that men have written about women should be viewed with suspicion, because they are both judge and party.

It may be unfair, but what happens in a few days, sometimes even a single day, can change the course of a whole lifetime.
- Khaled Hosseini

That’s the thing about people who mean everything they say. They think everyone else does too.
- Khaled Hosseini

If a hiker gets lost in the mountains, people will coordinate a search. If a train crashes, people will line up to give blood. If an earthquake levels a city, people all over the world will send emergency supplies. This is so fundamentally human that it’s found in every culture without exception. Yes, there are assholes who just don’t care, but they’re massively outnumbered by the people who do. 
- Andy Weir

All our science, measured against reality, is primitive and childlike - and yet it is the most precious thing we have.
- Albert Einstein

Men think epilepsy divine, merely because they do not understand it. But if they called everything divine which they do not understand, why, there would be no end of divine.
- Hippocrates

For what matters in life is not whether we receive a round of applause, what matters is whether we have the courage to venture forth despite the uncertainty of acclaim.
- Amor Towles

The soul in which philosophy dwells should by its health make even the body healthy. It should make its tranquility and gladness shine out from within; should form in its own mold the outward demeanour, and consequently arm it with a graceful pride, an active and joyous bearing, and a contented and good-natured countenance. The surest sign of wisdom is constant cheerfulness.
- Michel de Montaigne 

When one is travelling abroad for the first time, one does not wish to look back on laborsome instructions, weighty advice, or tearful sentiments. Like the memory of the simple soup, when one is homesick what one will find most comforting to recall are those lighthearted little stories that have been told a thousand times before.
- Amor Towles 

I feel very small. I don’t understand. I have so much courage, fire, energy, for many things, yet I get so hurt, so wounded by small things.
- Anaïs Nin 

Why wasn’t friendship as good as a relationship? Why wasn’t it even better? It was two people who remained together, day after day, bound not by sex or physical attraction or money or children or property, but only by the shared agreement to keep going, the mutual dedication to a union that could never be codified. 
- Hanya Yanagihara 

He was pleasantly exhausted, but then he was always exhausted those days: it was as if the daily effort it took to appear normal was so great that it left energy for little else.
- Hanya Yanagihara

I’m still learning to love the parts of me that no one claps for.
- Rudy Francisco 

Prudence necessarily leads to mediocrity.
- Simone de Beauvoir

What he knew, he knew from books, and books lied, they made things prettier.
- Hanya Yanagihara

And although our life, in this manifestation of it, is often worthless, yet it is life and not simply extracting square roots.
- Fyodor Dostoyevsky 

I have a longing for life, and I go on living in spite of logic. Though I may not believe in the order of the universe, yet I love the sticky little leaves as they open in spring. I love the blue sky, I love some people, whom one loves you know sometimes without knowing why. I love some great deeds done by men, though I’ve long ceased perhaps to have faith in them, yet from old habit one’s heart prized them. 
- Fyodor Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov (Ivan) 

No one should ever be bored. One can be horrified, or disgusted, but one can’t be bored.
- G.H. Hardy

Don’t aim at success - the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. 
- Viktor Frankl

No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same.
- Viktor Frankl

One should not search for an abstract meaning of life. Everyone has his own vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfilment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, everyone’s task is as unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it.
- Viktor Frankl

By declaring that man is responsible and 

To understand just one life, you have to swallow the world.
- Salman Rushdie

I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd attitude to take towards life. We are not sent into the world to air our moral prejudices. I never take any notice of what common people say, and I never interfere with what charming people do. If a personality fascinates me, whatever mode of expression that personality selects is absolutely delightful to me. 
- Oscar Wilde

To be good is to be in harmony with one’s self. Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. One’s own life - that is the important thing. As for the lives of one’s neighbours, if one wishes to be a prig or a Puritan, one can flaunt one’s moral views about them, but they are not one’s concern. Besides, Individualism has really the higher aim. Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one’s age. I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality.
- Oscar Wilde

There are only two kinds of people, who are really fascinating - people who know absolutely everything, and people who know absolutely nothing.
- Oscar Wilde

Above all, don’t lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love. 
- Fyodor Dostoevsky 

The mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive, but in finding something to live for. 
- Fyodor Dostoevsky 

How can a man of consciousness have the slightest of respect for himself?
- Dostoevsky 

Perhaps one never seems so much at one’s ease as when one has to play a part.
- Oscar Wilde

I was a hidden treasure and desired to be known; therefore I created the creation in order to be known.

Man will desire oblivion rather than not desire at all.
- Friedrich Nietzsche 

Man is sometimes extraordinarily, passionately, in love with suffering: that is a fact. 
- Fyodor Dostoevsky 

I know my life's meaningful because" - and here he stopped, and looked shy, and was silent for a moment before he continued - " because I'm a good friend. I love my friends, and I care about them, and I think I make them happy.
- Hanya Yanagihara 

Of course you are right, my dear friend, there would be less suffering among men if they did not—God knows why they are so constituted—expend so much zeal and imagination in recalling the memory of past ills, instead of enduring an indifferent present.
- Goethe

‘I told you the truth,’ I say yet again, ‘Memory’s truth, because memory has its own special kind. It selects, eliminates, alters, exaggerates, minimizes, glorifies, and vilifies also; but in the end it creates its own reality, its heterogenous but usually coherent version of events; and no sane human being ever trusts someone else’s version more than his own.’
- Salman Rushdie 

Who what am I? My answer: I am the sum total of everything that went before me, of all I have been seen done, of everything done-to-me. I am everyone everything whose being-in-the-world affected was affected by mine. I am anything that happens after I’ve gone which would not have happened if I had not done. Nor am I particularly exceptional in this matter; each ‘I’, every one of the now six-hundred million-plus of us, contains a similar multitude. I repeat for the last time: to understand me, you’ll have to swallow a world.
- Salman Rushdie, Midnight’s Children

Don’t be overwise; fling yourself straight into life, without deliberation; don’t be afraid - the flood will bear you to the bank and set you safe again.
- Fyodor Dostoevsky

Many people seem to think it foolish, even superstitious, to believe that the world could still change for the better. And it is true that in winter it is sometimes so bitingly cold that one is tempted to say, ‘What do I care if there is a summer; its warmth is no help to me now.’ Yes, evil often seems to surpass good. But then, in spite of us, and without our permission, there comes at last an end to the bitter frosts. One morning the wind turns, and there is a thaw. And so I must still have hope.
- Vincent van Gogh 

Don’t take my devils away, because my angels may flee too. 
- Rainer Maria Milke 

Just because she likes the same bizarro crap you do doesn’t mean she’s your soulmate.
- 500 Days of Summer

While the astronauts, heroes forever, spent mere hours on the moon, I have remained in this new world for nearly thirty years. I know that my achievement is quite ordinary. I am not the only man to seek his fortune far from home, and certainly I am not the first. Still, there are times I am bewildered by each mile I have travelled, each meal I have eaten, each person I have known, each room in which I have slept. As ordinary as it all appears, there are times when it is beyond my imagination. 
- Jhumpa Lahiri, Interpreter of Maladies

I am tired of myself, I should like to be someone else tonight.
- Oscar Wilde

So, if you are too tired to speak, sit next to me for I, too, am fluent in silence.

You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.
- Albert Camus 

Man is the only creature who refuses to be what he is.

I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world.

Stand in the trench, Achilles, flame-capped, and shout for me.

For what is a writer, if not an interpreter of maladies.

Don’t bend, don’t water it down; don’t try to make it logical; don’t edit your own soul according to the fashion. Rather, follow your most intense obsessions mercilessly. 
- Franz Kafka 

I am not sure that I exist, actually. I am all the writers I have read, all the people that I have met, all the women that I have loved; all the cities I have visited. 
- Jorge Luis Borges 

Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else’s opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation. 
- Oscar Wilde 

Children begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they judge them; sometimes they forgive them.
- Oscar Wilde 

The amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been proportional to the amount of genius, mental vigour, and moral courage which it contained. That so few now dare to be eccentric, marks the chief danger of the time.
- John Stuart Mill

If people never did silly things nothing intelligent would ever get done. 
- Ludwig Wittgenstein 

A serious and good philosophical work could be written consisting entirely of jokes. 
- Ludwig Wittgenstein 

To go from the phantoms of faith to the ghosts of reason is merely to change cells.
- Bernardo Soares (Fernando Pessoa)

That is part of the beauty of all literature. You discover that your longings are universal longings, that you’re not lonely and isolated from anyone. You belong.
- Fitzgerald 

The life that I could still live, I should live, and the thoughts that I could still think, I should think.
- C. G. Jung

In her head there could be a great deal of acting and many strange things could happen in there, but her emotions were sincere and they revolted, they prevented her from getting lost down in the deep corridors of her inventions. Through them she knew. They were her eyes, her divining rod, they were her truth.
- Anais Nin

I was an unctuous, repulsively good little boy. My childhood did not prepare me for the fact that the world is full of cruel and bitter things.
- J. Robert Oppenheimer

Laughter I declare to be blessed; you who aspire to greatness, learn how to laugh! 
- Nietzsche

It’s the central error of the literary imagination: to suppose that others are like us and must feel as we do.
- Pessoa 

Beyond the vast sorrows and all the vexations that weigh upon our lives and obscure our vision, happy is he who can with his vigourous wing soar up towards those fields luminous and serene, he whose thoughts, like skylarks, toward the morning sky take flight — who hovers over life and understands with ease the language of flowers and silent things! 
- Charles Baudelaire 

The staircase wall on which I saw the rising glimmer of his candle has long since ceased to exist. In me, too, many things have been destroyed that I thiught were bound to last forever and new ones have formed that have given birth to new sorrows and joys which I could not have foreseen then, just as the old ones have become difficult for me to understand. 
- Marcel Proust

Look for light and freedom and do not ponder too deeply over the evil in life. 
- Vincent van Gogh

It was not his extravagant use of this freedom which had killed her feeling for him, but his inability to make her feel at the center of his life, feel that no matter what his peripheries she remained at the center. In exchange for her self-forgetfulness he had not been able to give anything, only to take. He had exploited the goodness, the largeness, the voluntary blindness. He had dipped into the immense reservoir of her love without returning to it an equal flow of tenderness, and so it had dried. The boundlessness of her love was to him merely an encouragement of his irresponsibility. He thought it could be used infinitely, not knowing that even an infinite love needed nourishment and fecundation; that no love was ever self-sustaining, self-propelling, self-renewing. 
- Anais Nin

For the sake of one wish yet unfulfilled he thought but little of everything else that heaven had granted him. That is how humans are made!
- Nizami

It was as if his name had been torn out of the Book of Life, and he had fallen into nothing-ness; as if he were no longer one of the living, and not yet one of the dead. 
- Nizami

Love, if not true, is but a plaything of the senses, fading like youth. Time perishes, but not true love. All may be imagination and delusion, but not love. The charcoal brazier on which it burns is eternity itself, without beginning or end. 
- Nizami

He who remains a stranger in this world and wanders, restless as the moon at night, will find peace. Man is as lightning, born to die, not to seek permanence in the house of suffering. Do not settle down to rest here, where everything perishes; you will only regret it later. But if you die your own death in this life, tearing yourself away from the world which is a demon with the face of an angel, you will share eternal life. You are your fate, your death, your life. Good will be joined to good, evil to evil. The echo shouts your secret from the mountain-tops, revealing only what you confided yourself.
- Nizami

What we are and possess is but a loan—and that not for long! Do not clutch what had been given to you, for joy and desire to possess are but nailed fastening you to the perishable world.

She had read any number of them, from Fielding to Thomas Mann.

It had the same significance for her as an elegant cane for the dandy a century ago. It differentiated her from the others. 
- Milan Kundera

Aware of his weakness, a man decides to give in rather than stand up to it. He is drunk with weakness, wishes to grow even weaker, wishes to fall down in the middle of the main square in front of everybody, wishes to be down, lower than down. 
- Milan Kundera

Indeed, the only truly serious questions are ones that even a child can formulate. Only the most naive of questions are truly serious. They are the questions with no answers. A question with no answer is a barrier that cannot be breached. In other words, it is questions with no answersvthat set the limits of humanvpossibilities, describe the boundaries of human existence. 
- Milan Kundera
