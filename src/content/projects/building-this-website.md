I am hilariously bad at frontend development. If you asked me to explain how HTML, JavaScript, CSS worked, you'd start questioning how I'm even employed as a software engineer at all. However, I built this website on my own with the assistance of Kiro, and here are some of the key things to keep in mind when developing with an AI assistant. 

### Less is more
AI is best when you give it bite-sized features to work on. If I had Kiro a single prompt to generate the entire project, it would have failed spectacularly. Instead, work with it as if you're working with a child -- a child that is 

### Commit small, often, and on your own
When working with AI, you shouldn't forget core software engineering best practices. Small changes are always better than large changes. It makes it easier to revert to a working version when (not if) the AI hallucinates, or makes 300 changes for a feature you decide wasn't really worth it after all. Finally, don't rely on the assistant to make commits. Make the commits manually and ensure that everything that is being added in a commit is strictly necessary for that feature. 

### Be at the helm 
Your assistant might be making the changes, but a project without direction is doomed to fail. Even though you're not necessarily writing the code, be aware of all the moving parts and how they come together. 

### It's an assistant, not a replacement
