I had the amazing opportunity in university to work at the ATLAS experiment at CERN with some professors at the University of Toronto. CERN, for those who might not be aware, is the world's largest particle accelerator! It's a 27km circular tunnel under France and Switzerland (straddling the border around Geneva) where atoms are accelerated and smashed into each other at almost light speed (that's 3 million m/s). The idea is that smashing things together often 'breaks' the particles into their smaller fundamental constituents, which we really want to study. The accelerator was completed in 2008 (?) and in 2012, it proved its worth by finally discovering the Higgs boson, the newest particle in our 16-particle 'Standard Model', which is our best physical theory of the world we live in.  

I specifically worked with Professor Pekka Sinervo. My research concerned measuring the production of the Higgs boson and the top quark, two fundamental particles, in the 'boosted all-hadronic' final state. What does that mean? Boosted refers to the momentum of the particles, and we specifically concerned ourselves with 

Why such a specific study, you might ask? Well, the issue is that when you get down to the work, it's exceptionally complicated to extract meaningful data out of the accelerator. 

As part of my research, I was also lucky enough to spend 2 months on site in Geneva. I got to stay in a tranquil French village St. Genis Pouilly where they had maybe the world's best chocolate croissants, and 
It was very picturesque. 

Thanks to my presence on site, and my colleague, Sahibjeet's efforts, I was actually also able to do a few shifts in the ATLAS control room, on my own! 

I'll admit I didn't quite know what I was doing, but our job was mostly to sound the alarm anyways. Still, it was pretty cool to be in the control room itself. 

Regrets? I was so anti-social the entire summer I barely made any friends. I feel like I really squandered an opportunity. But at the same time I was having the time of my life reading. It was one of the most productive summers I had in terms of books read.
