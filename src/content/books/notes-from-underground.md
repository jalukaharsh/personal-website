Takeaway: Strive very, very hard to not be the underground man! A naive reading of the book can lead one to believe that Dostoevsky heroifies — or at least justifies — the underground man as a martyr wronged by society. (The underground man himself does think so, and I know that I did agree with him for a while). Ultimately, however, you must recognise that the underground man is the victim of nothing but his own mind. He leads an exceptionally unhappy life, and therein lies the gravest danger of his mode of thought.
