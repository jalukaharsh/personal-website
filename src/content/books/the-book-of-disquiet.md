Verdict: In Pessoa you will find a sympathetic soul, perhaps an expression for the meaninglessness of it all, for the unjust of life -- and certainly that has value -- but Pessoa does not transcend his maladies. His approach to life is destructive, resignatory, sadistic, and ultimately, uninspiring.
