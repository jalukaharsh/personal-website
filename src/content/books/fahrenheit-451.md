This book says a lot of important things, but those things have also been said elsewhere, better. 

It's short, terse, and tells you clearly what it wants you to believe. There is no serious debate, or discussion to be had inspired by the book. 

A book that conveys similar ideas but inspires much more thought is `Brave New World` by `Aldous Huxley`. If you had to choose one between the two, I'd go for `Brave New World`.

It almost feels like literature for those who don't really read literature.
