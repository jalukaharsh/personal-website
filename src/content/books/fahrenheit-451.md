This book says a lot of important things, but the same things have also been said elsewhere, better. It's short, terse, and tells you clearly what it wants you to believe. I don't think there is any serious debate, or discussion to be had inspired by the book. 

I'd recommend Brave New World, one of my favourite books of all time, over it! It lends itself to much more discussion and debate over the same ideas.
